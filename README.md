# Lab-05 Franco

Download the zip file and load from the Unreal Engine Brower.
Other option is just loading from the application attached in the file.

Part one and two of the lab are done. Onlything that does not work is the rotation of the platform after the actor steps on it.
If you go into the blueprint you can see it is written out but was not able to figure out the flow of it.
